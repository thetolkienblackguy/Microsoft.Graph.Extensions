  -ExcludeGroups

Get-GraphGroupMember
  -GroupId <string>
  [-Recursive]
  -ExcludeUsers
```

## Description

The `Get-GraphGroupMember` function provides a flexible way to retrieve group members using the Microsoft Graph API. It supports retrieving direct members or recursively getting members of nested groups. The function also allows for excluding either groups or users from the results.

## Parameters

```

### Example 2: Get members of a group by display name
```powershell
Get-MgGroup -Filter "displayName eq 'My Group'" | Get-GraphGroupMember
```

### Example 3: Get members recursively
