# Get-GraphGroupBasedLicenseAssignment.md

`Get-GraphGroupBasedLicenseAssignment` is a PowerShell function that retrieves information about licenses assigned to groups using the Microsoft Graph API.

## Synopsis

This function returns licenses assigned to groups.

## Syntax

```powershell
Get-GraphGroupBasedLicenseAssignment
  -SkuId <string>
```

## Description

The `Get-GraphGroupBasedLicenseAssignment` function provides a way to retrieve information about group-based license assignments in Azure AD. It accepts a SKU ID as input and returns details about the groups that have been assigned that particular license.

## Parameters

- `-SkuId <string>`
  Specifies the SKU ID of the license to return the groups for. This can be a single SKU ID.

## Examples

### Example 1: Get groups assigned a specific license
```powershell
Get-GraphGroupBasedLicenseAssignment -SkuId "6fd2c87f-b296-42f0-b197-1e91e994b900"
```

### Example 2: Get group-based license assignments for all subscribed SKUs
```powershell
Get-MgSubscribedSku | Get-GraphGroupBasedLicenseAssignment | Format-List
```

## Notes

- The function caches subscribed SKUs to improve performance when making multiple calls.
- It creates a lookup table for SKUs to quickly retrieve SKU information.
- The function uses the `GraphLicenseGroupObject` class to create custom objects for the output. Make sure this class is defined in your environment.

## Output

The function outputs custom objects of type `GraphLicenseGroupObject`. These objects contain information about the groups and the licenses assigned to them.
